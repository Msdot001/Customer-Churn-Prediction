# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Churn rate is a critical metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rates mean happy customers; high churn rates mean customers are leaving you. 

## Mission objectives

- Build machine learning models for classification and clustering.
- Select the right performance metrics for your model.
- Identify the optimal number of clusters and be able to describe them.
- Tuning parameters of the model for better performance.
- Describe the results from unsupervised learning.
- Deploy your findings in a dashboard that highlights the business insights.

## The Mission

An important financial institution is interested in analyzing its client database to increase the revenue generated from credit cardholders. They are concern about customers closing their bank accounts after accepting products from other institutions.

The churn rate is above 15% and increasing, the CEO urges the marketing team to start a marketing campaign for client retention.

Your mission:

- Predict those clients with more propensity to close their bank account with the financial institution
- Find possible groups of clients and define their characteristics. This will help the marketing team to design custom-made campaigns to increase customer retention.
- Build a dashboard with data insights and KPIs.

#### What is Churn Rate ?

_The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period._
